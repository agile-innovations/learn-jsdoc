> "Good code is its own best documentation. <br />
> As you're about to add a comment, ask yourself, <br />
> 'How can I improve the code so that this comment isn't needed?' <br />
> Improve the code and then document it to make it even clearer."

> "Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code <br />
